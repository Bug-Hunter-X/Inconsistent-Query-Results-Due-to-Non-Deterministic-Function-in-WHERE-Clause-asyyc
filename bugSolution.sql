To fix this issue, avoid using non-deterministic functions in the WHERE clause. If a function must be used to filter data, ensure that it's deterministic (always returns the same output for the same input) and that any other factors such as timestamps are handled deterministically. For example, instead of directly comparing with `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`, the query could be changed to compare with a specific timestamp value.

Example Solution:
Instead of:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE RAND() < 0.5; 
```
Use a deterministic filtering mechanism:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE employee_id % 2 = 0; --select even id's
```

For the `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` example, introduce a deterministic comparison, perhaps by using an explicit timestamp value:
Instead of:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() > creation_date;
```
Try something like:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE '2024-03-08 10:00:00' > creation_date; --replace with a fixed timestamp value
```
Or, if you want to check against the time the query is run, move the function into the SELECT statement instead of WHERE.
```sql
SELECT *, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() as query_time FROM products WHERE creation_date < '2024-03-08 10:00:00'; 
```
This ensures that you are getting the result you expect instead of relying on the results of a non-deterministic function to filter the data.
