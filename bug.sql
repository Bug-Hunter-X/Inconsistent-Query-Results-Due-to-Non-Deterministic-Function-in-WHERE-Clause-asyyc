The SQL query uses a function in the WHERE clause that is not deterministic. This can lead to unexpected results or errors, especially when the query is executed multiple times or by different users.  A non-deterministic function may return different results each time it is called, even with the same input, due to factors such as system time or temporary data.

Example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE RAND() < 0.5;
```
This query uses the RAND() function, which is non-deterministic. Each time this query is run, different rows might be selected, since RAND() produces different random numbers every time.

Another example that can create issues is using functions that implicitly use system variables which change across different times or sessions:
```sql
SELECT * FROM products WHERE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP() > creation_date;
```
The `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()` function might return different results between different execution times or users which is unpredictable.
